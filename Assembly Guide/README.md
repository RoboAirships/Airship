# Assembly Guide

## Components
The Bill_of_Materials.xlsx document contains the list of required components to assemble the airship.
It also includes product numbers, prices and links to reseller webpages.

## Motor Driver Connection
The motor drivers can be connected directly to the Raspberry Pi GPIO, as is depicted in the schematic below.
They can be soldered directly to the pins or connected through an appropriate pinheader for easier replacement.
Motor power should be supplied directly from the battery (appropriate pins on the step-up voltage regulator).
